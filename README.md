## Typed Challenges

To access features like multi-line strings, build your challenge in typescript and run it with `ts-node`.

```bash
ts-node typescript/stol.ts
```

### Dependency on `ts-node`

But first you need to install `ts-node`. Usually you'll want to do it globally, so you can run it from any directory. To do so, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install -g ts-node
```

You can also install it locally:

```bash
npm install ts-node
```

Note that when you install it locally, you'll need to run it with `npx`:

```bash
npx ts-node typescript/stol.ts
```

### Dependency on `npm` and `node.js`

If you don't have `npm` installed, you can install it with [node.js](https://nodejs.org/).
